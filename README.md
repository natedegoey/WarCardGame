# WarCardGame
My first iOS app, a very simple War Card game! Under the teachings of CodeWithChris, I succeeded in creating this simple application that allows the user to press a button on the screen, causing the two cards on the screen to change, and awarding a point to the higher cards team. A very simple application that began my excitement for iOS development. Thank you CodeWithChris!
